# PokéVM
--------
## Objectives
#### Clean & Meaningful Code
1. Implementing a modular architecture - *The Reavealing Module Pattern*.
    a. Module Pattern that emulates the concept of classes with public & private variables & methods encapsulated within an object.
    c. Accomplished with high module cohesion, strict reduction in globally scope variables, and IIFEs (Immediately Involked Function Expressions) 
#### Performant Operations (Without Disrupting Readability)
    a. Accomplished using ES6 imports and exports.
    b. Async / Await functions, and thoughtful implementation of modules.
#### Improve My Understanding of Vanilla JavaScript, HTML/DOM, & CSS
    a. Accomplished by
        1. Learning about JavaScript under the hood (JS Event Loop)
        2. Abstinence from any abstractions
2. To become a better developer by gaining a deeper understanding of vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS without the abstraction that libaries and frameworks provide (to fully appreciate them with future projects).
    * Explore the capabilities of HTML
3. To implement a responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
    - By understanding fluid typography (responsive CSS units).
    - Limiting breakpoints and media queries.

### Notes
* We want loosly coupled modules.
